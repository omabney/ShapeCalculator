# Overview

## Description

### Shape Calculator
This application is for finding the **2D shape properties** using Kotlin. In this application 
user will be able to find the area and perimeter of a chosen shape.

Here user will be asked to select a shape and user will be asked to give the appropriate measurement for the shape.
Based on the given input, application will calculate the area and perimeter.

If user provide invalid measurement then the application will let the user know about
the error and area and perimeter will be shown as Computational error.

## Purpose:

By developing this application, the main goal was to get to know more about the Kotlin program and to learn more about **Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, classes.**
